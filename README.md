## This repo contains example solutions for python coding challenges.

### This repo is for anyone interested in python-based data science challenges, their possible solutions, and examples of my code (that are not subject to a non-disclosure agreement).


### Enjoy and happy coding :-)

The code is presented in the form of ipython notebooks.
Each folder contains a 'setup_notes.txt' file. This file describes how to set up the environment for running the respective notebook.
