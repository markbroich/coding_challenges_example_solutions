## This repo contains example solutions for data science problems and competitive coding challenges in python.

### This repo is for anyone interested in python-based data science and competitive programming challenges, their possible solutions, and examples of my code (that are not subject to a non-disclosure agreement).


### Enjoy and happy coding :-)

The code is presented in the form of python code and in some cases ipython notebooks.
Each folder contains a 'setup_notes.txt' file. This file describes how to set up the environment for running the respective code.
